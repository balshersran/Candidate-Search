## Description

This project was to showcase my progression through this journey of learning typescript/React JS. This project also shows my knowledge now of routes/fetching api data from an outside source, in this case GitHub, and storing the data locally and calling it again to render on a separate page. It's a Candidate Search app that allows users to cycle through github portfolios and get a short card description of the candidates.
